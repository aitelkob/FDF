# FDF

A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate models, color is defined by
relative height in the map. More features planned!

## Features
* Simple file format definition (array of space-separated integers)
* 3D rotations with the mouse
* Camera controls (zoom, translate)
* Pretty color gradients!
* Double-buffered
* Line clipping

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run it with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `maps`
directory. The one in the screenshot above is `maps/42.fdf`.

Controls are: drag with left click to rotate, drag with right to zoom, drag with
both to move around.
